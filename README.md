Custom Cache - C# Caching Library 🚀
Overview 📋
A high-performance, generic caching library for C# applications that provides in-memory caching capabilities for any data type with any key type. This library is designed to significantly improve application performance by reducing redundant data fetching operations. ⚡
Problem Statement 🐌
Many applications suffer from performance bottlenecks when repeatedly fetching the same data from slow sources (databases, APIs, file systems, etc.). For example, if a DownloadData method takes 1 second to execute, calling it multiple times for the same data ID results in unnecessary delays and resource consumption. 😴
Solution 💡
The Custom Cache library provides a generic caching mechanism that:

💾 Stores frequently accessed data in memory
🔧 Supports any data type and key type combination
⚡ Dramatically reduces data access time for cached items
🛡️ Maintains thread safety for concurrent operations

Key Features ✨
🚀 Generic Type Support

Design Patterns & Technologies Used 🏗️
🎯 Primary Pattern: Decorator Pattern - Enhances data access operations with caching capabilities
🔗 Secondary Pattern: Chain of Responsibility Pattern - Handles cache miss scenarios gracefully
📦 Generic Types: Full generic type support for maximum flexibility and type safety
🗂️ Dictionary: High-performance key-value storage using Dictionary<TKey, TValue>
Works with any key type (string, int, Guid, custom objects, etc.) 🔑
Supports any data type (primitives, complex objects, collections) 📦
Type-safe operations with compile-time checking ✅

⚡ Performance Optimization

First access: Normal speed (data fetched from source) 🐌
Subsequent access: Near-instantaneous retrieval from cache 🏎️
Significant performance improvement for repeated data access 📈

🛡️ Thread Safety

Safe for use in multi-threaded applications 🔒
Concurrent read/write operations supported 🔄
No data corruption or race conditions 🛡️

🔧 Easy Integration

Simple, intuitive API 🎯
Minimal setup required ⚙️
Drop-in replacement for existing data access patterns 🔄

Usage Example 💻
```bash
csharp// Create a cache instance
var cache = new Cache<string, UserData>();
  ```
 
```bash
// First access - slow (fetches from source) 🐌
var userData1 = cache.Get("user123", () => DownloadUserData("user123"));
  ```
```bash
 
// Second access - fast (served from cache) ⚡
var userData2 = cache.Get("user123", () => DownloadUserData("user123"));
Benefits 🎯
  ```

Reduced Response Time: Eliminate redundant data fetching operations ⏱️
Lower Resource Usage: Minimize database/API calls and network traffic 📊
Improved User Experience: Faster application response times 😊
Scalability: Handle more concurrent users with the same resources 📈
Cost Efficiency: Reduce cloud computing costs through optimized resource usage 💰

Use Cases 🛠️

Web Applications: Cache user sessions, configuration data, lookup tables 🌐
APIs: Store frequently requested data and reduce database load 🔌
Desktop Applications: Cache file contents, user preferences, computed results 🖥️
Microservices: Share cached data across service instances 🔗
Data Processing: Store intermediate results in ETL pipelines 📊
